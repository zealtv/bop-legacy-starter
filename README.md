# bop-starter
A starter template for a new bop sketch.

### What is bop?
[bop](https://github.com/zealtv/bop) is a suite of digital music making modules for Purr Data and Pure Data.  It makes computerised things musical.

### What are Purr Data and Pure Data?
Pure Data, or PD, is visual programming environment for sound and music.  It is old, open-source, and rad.
Purr Data is a variant of Pure Data that includes many additional features including a modern, java-script based frontend. I recommend Purr Data in most cases unless you are a current or aspiring pd ninja.

## Step 0
Obtain a  windows, mac, or linux computer with an audio output and install [Purr Data](https://github.com/agraef/purr-data/releases) on itI
.f you know what you are doing, instead install [Pure Data](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data) and use Deken to install cyclone, iemguts, and freeverb.

## Step 1
open a terminal and cd to the destination directory of you project.  If in doubt, just recklessly copy and paste the below:
```
cd ~
```

## Step 2
clone this repository, including bop as a submodule.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zealtv/bop-starter
```

## Step 3
Open sketch001.pd in Purr Data*

* or pd vanilla + cyclone, iemguts & freeverb libraries.

** this is all pretty fresh.  expect gremlins. vanilla compatability currently dubious **
